# Star Radiation Analysis
This group project was developed during the Inferential Statistics course, held at Politecnico di Milano, during the 2nd Semester of 2024.
Taught by professor [Anna Maria Paganoni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-maria-paganoni-a85732267/), the course covered tools for inferential statistics and regression models.

Our team was made up of Mattia Bertoli, Matteo Campagnoli ([@Dr4k3z](https://github.com/Dr4k3z)), Riccardo Girgenti ([@rikygirg](https://github.com/rikygirg)), and Benedetta Palmieri. The project obtained a final evaluation of 4/4.

## Summary
We studied the luminosity emitted by 240 stars of various sizes, classes, and origins. By performing extensive regression analysis on the radiation spectrum, we derived a linear relation between the log-scale luminosity and the log-scale radius and temperature of the celestial bodies. Our results agree with the black-body approximation of Stefan-Boltzmann.
